# Introduction To Machine Learning: Titanic

This repo is just a notebook I used in one of my [Medium/Blog post.](https://medium.com/@tomas.ertola/introducci%C3%B3n-a-machine-learning-para-principiantes-9aee97cc77f)


# How to use it:

Clone this repo in the directory you want, then run 
 ```pip install -r requirements.txt ``` <br>
 
 ## Important:
 
 **Important:** in order to run the last line in the notebook to upload your submission to kaggle you need to have installed the official Kaggle API. [Kaggle Docs](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api)
